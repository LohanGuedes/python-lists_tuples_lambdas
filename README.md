# Project: Lists, Tuples & Lambdas
Anyone who completes this project shows that they can...

* Use and work with Lists
* Use and work with Tuples & Named Tuples
* Create and use Lambda Functions

## Objectives 
* write a basic for loop
* use conditional logic to filter for data
* use sort and map functions
* create and use Tuples & Named Tuples
* use Lambda Functions

## Introduction
In this set of assignments, you will solve a number of problems while working with fundamental Python collections being Lists, Tuples, Named Tuples and Dictionaries. 

Excercises are in...
* lists/lists.py
* tuples/tuples.py
* lambdas/lambdas.py

Inorder to complete the problems you will need to use loops, conditional logic and other mechanisms that you see fit. You will also learn how to convert normal functions into Lambda functoins. Lambdas are used in functions like `map, sort, filter and reduce` to name a few.

## Instruction

* [ ] Please fork and clone this repository. Regularly commit and push your code as appropriate.
* [ ] Before you begin work, get familiar with the project and each of the files.
* [ ] Complete each of the problem sets in the `Lists, Tuples & Lambdas` folders.
    * Some of the problem sets have test files, if you would like to test your code againt the unit tests run `python <test file>.py` or `python3 <test file>.py`
    
> **Running Tests**
